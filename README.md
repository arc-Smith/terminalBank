# Terminal Bank

This is a simple terminal-based banking application built to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It serves as a hands-on exercise in applying foundational principles to a practical scenario.

---

## Key OOP Concepts

* **Classes & Objects:** Modeling different bank accounts (Checking, Savings, and CD) as distinct classes.
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting account data by using private fields and public methods for interaction.
* **Methods:** Implementing core banking functions like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `save`.

## How to Run

This is a command-line application. The `Main.java` file serves as the central entry point for the program allowing customers to create a CD, Checking, or Savings account and then interact with those accounts using save, deposit, and withdraw methods.

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Compile the Java files** from your terminal.
3.  **Run the `Main.java` file** to launch the program and begin interacting with the bank accounts.
